# GraphicalAnalysis

Analysis of CryptoPunks dataset (from Kaggle) using Python's NetworkX package. Assessed the network topology and plotted histograms of the degree frequency and the betweenness centrality. Calculated the graph distance and analyzed the Graph Connectivity and Graph Clustering by calculating the Transitivity and Average Clustering Coefficient of the network. Implemented random graph models like Erdős–Rényi Model, Preferential Attatchment Model and Small World Networks, and plotted each's transitivity, average clustering coefficient and degree frequency.
